# lays-chips-clone
I cloned this website to practice my HTML and CSS skills, and to learn more about responsive design. I am pleased with the results, and I think this website is a good example of what can be achieved with HTML and CSS.

I used the following HTML and CSS techniques to create this website:
> HTML: I used HTML to structure the content of the website and to create the layout of the pages. </br>
> CSS: I used CSS to style the content of the website and to create the responsive design.
---
I also used the following tools and resources to create this website:
> Visual Studio Code: I used Visual Studio Code as my text editor. </br>
> Live Server: I used Live Server to preview the website as I was developing it. </br>
> W3Schools: I used W3Schools as a reference for HTML and CSS.

I am still under development, but I am proud of the Lays chips website clone that I have created. I think it is a good example of what I can do with HTML and CSS. I am also pleased with the fact that the website is responsive and that it loads quickly.
